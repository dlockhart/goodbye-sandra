In my short time on the team its become apparent just how invaluable you are, Shopify is lucky to have you! I couldn\'t find a photo from the one time we went out as a team after I joined but hopefully this one brings back some good memories from partying hard at Winterfest!'

If you're looking at this years and years from now and the site is miraculously still up, remember Daylight and how you totally nailed it. Remember all the people you helped by making an awesomely accessible product! And don't be a stranger :)"

Thank you for taking me out to lunch when I first started part-time with Gaudi... when I was feeling out of place you made me feel very welcome. You\'re a big part of why this team is so special. Even in this WFH environment, I recommend finding some way to make your milkshakes for your new co-workers - they\'re an instant win!'

In my short time on the team its become apparent just how invaluable you are, Shopify is lucky to have you! I couldn\'t find a photo from the one time we went out as a team after I joined but hopefully this one brings back some good memories from partying hard at Winterfest!'

Endless celebrations of new roles, titles, projects, responsibilities, teams and managers intermingled with new houses, weddings, puppies and babies. When you started at D2L you didn\'t want to mix work & pleasure, and I\'m thankful that didn\'t happen! See you at the cottage!'

If you're looking at this years and years from now and the site is miraculously still up, remember Daylight and how you totally nailed it. Remember all the people you helped by making an awesomely accessible product! And don't be a stranger :)"
